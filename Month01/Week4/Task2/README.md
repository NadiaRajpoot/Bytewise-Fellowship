## Task02- Difference between framework and libraray.

- The main difference between a `library` and a `framework` is something called “Inversion of Control.” Libraries are a collection of functions that other programs can use, and you have complete control over when and how you use those functions. But with a framework, things are a bit different. The framework sets the rules for how your project is organized, and your code has to follow those rules. Instead of you calling functions from the framework, the framework calls functions from your code.

**_What is a Library?_**

- A library is like a collection of pre-written code that programmers can use to make their work easier and faster.
- It contains a set of functions and classes that can be used to complete tasks without having to write code from scratch.
- These pre-written functions can help simplify the process and save time. Most programming languages have a standard library, but programmers can also create their own custom libraries.
- Libraries usually have a smaller size and focus on specific tasks, such as working with strings, sockets, and input/output.
- Examples of libraries include jQuery and NumPy.
